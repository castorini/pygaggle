PyGaggle provides a gaggle of deep neural architectures for text ranking and question answering.
It was designed for tight integration with [Pyserini](http://pyserini.io/), but can be easily adapted for other sources as well.

Currently, this repo contains implementations of the rerankers for MS MARCO Passage Retrieval, MS MARCO Document Retrieval, TREC-COVID and [CovidQA](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/data/).

## Installation

0. Install via PyPI `pip install pygaggle`. Requires [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Additional Instructions

0. Clone the repo with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle.git`

0. Make you sure you have an installation of [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/). All `python` commands below refer to this.

0. For pip, do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * If you prefer Anaconda, use `conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate pygaggle`.


## A Simple Reranking Example

Here's how to initalize the T5 reranker from [Document Ranking with a Pretrained Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06713.pdf):

```python
from pygaggle.rerank.base import Query, Text
from pygaggle.rerank.transformer import MonoT5

reranker =  MonoT5()
```

Alternatively, here's the BERT reranker from [Passage Re-ranking with BERT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04085.pdf), which isn't as good as the T5 reranker:

```python
from pygaggle.rerank.base import Query, Text
from pygaggle.rerank.transformer import MonoBERT

reranker =  MonoBERT()
```

Either way, continue with a complete reranking example:

```python
# Here's our query:
query = Query('who proposed the geocentric theory')

# Option 1: fetch some passages to rerank from MS MARCO with Pyserini
from pyserini.search import SimpleSearcher
searcher = SimpleSearcher('/path/to/msmarco/index/')
hits = searcher.search(query.text)

from pygaggle.rerank.base import hits_to_texts
texts = hits_to_texts(hits)

# Option 2: here's what Pyserini would have retrieved, hard-coded

texts = [ Text(p[1], {'docid': p[0]}, 0) for p in passages] # Note, pyserini scores don't matter since T5 will ignore them.

# Either option, let's print out the passages prior to reranking:
for i in range(0, 10):
    print(f'{i+1:2} {texts[i].metadata["docid"]:15} {texts[i].score:.5f} {texts[i].text}')

# Finally, rerank:
reranked = reranker.rerank(query, texts)
reranked.sort(key=lambda x: x.score, reverse=True)

# Print out reranked results:
